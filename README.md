Final note: When it comes to the actual booking system, I didn’t finish it since I have an exam in two days. However, you can still get a great insight into how the system works in the data generation file.

Another reason I didn’t complete the project on time is that I might have enjoyed this task more than I should have and turned it into a game. It’s a simulation game where the user has full control over the system, trying to make a profit out of it in 100 days!

I didn’t upload this code as it is not relevant to the current state of the project. If I manage to finish this project after the exams, I will push the changes to this repo.
